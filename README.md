This a free to use fuel uplift calculator.

1- you need to enter the values for arrival fuel, fuel reading after refueling, the specific gravity and the uplifted amount either in liters or US gallons.

2- If fuel uplift is in liters click Uplift in liters 
if uplift is in US gallons click uplift in gallons button to calculate the result.
then you will get the result(calculated uplift, metered uplift and the discrepancy both in percent and in liters).

3- that is all you need to do.
